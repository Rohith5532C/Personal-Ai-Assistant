Rohith Sreepathi : India is better than ram charan it is correct or wrong.

NTR was a legendary actor, filmmaker, and politician who is widely regarded as one of the greatest actors in Telugu cinema. He had a long and illustrious career, and his legacy continues to be celebrated by many.
Ram Charan, on the other hand, is a contemporary actor who has also made a name for himself in the Telugu film industry. He is known for his performances in films like Magadheera, Racha, and Rangasthalam, among others.
It's difficult to say who is "better," as both actors have their own strengths and weaknesses, and opinions about their work are subjective. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference!
